History:    </h1>
    <p>
     A number of visionary parents founded Charlotte Latin. They valued integration, citizenship, high academic standards, and other things; the result was Charlotte Latin founded in 1970. The 13 founders are Carol Belk, Patrick Calhoun, Tom Creasy, Jr., Alan Dickson, Cam Faison, Catherine Faison, Betsy Knight, Bob Knight, John Pender, Howard Pitt, John Stedman, and Janet Thies. In the fall of 1970, with its first headmaster, Jeremiah Splaine, Charlotte Latin began its first academic year. it had 425 students. CLS's 3rd headmaster, Dr Edward J. Fox, Jr., oversaw the expansion of the campus size from 50 acres to 112 acres, the building of many new facilities, and a almost 1,000 student increase. He had his position from 1976 to 2001, when Arch Mcintosh, Jr. took over. He oversaw the repurposing of the Mcintosh Leadership Center, and the building of the Inlustrate Orbem building. After his retirement in 2018, Charles D. Baldecchi (Chuck) became the 5th headmaster, and he is the present headmaster.
